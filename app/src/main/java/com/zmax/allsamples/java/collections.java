    List: contains duplicate elements
    	ArrayList  - manipulation is slow. Used for storing and accesing elements
    	LinkedList – manipulation is fast
    Set: Removes duplicate elements
    	Hash Set – uses hash table to store elements. Contains unique elements.
    HashSet does not maintain any order.
    It allows null values
    More faster


    	Linked HashSet - LinkedHashSet maintains insertion order of elements.
    It allows null values
    Little faster
    	TreeSet -  TreeSet maintains sorting order or elements (ascending order).
    It does not allow null values. If you store null values it will throw nullPointer Exception.
    Slow compared to hashSet and LinkedHashSet
    Map:
        	Hash Map: Key  value pair
    o	It contains only unique elements.
    o	It may have one null key and multiple null values.
    o	It maintains no order.
    	LinkedHash Map:
    It is same as HashMap instead maintains insertion order
    	Tree Map:
    TreeMap maintains ascending order.
    TreeMap can not contain any null key.
    HashMap Vs HashTable:
        	HashMap is non synchronized.
        	 It is not-thread safe and can't be shared between many threads without proper synchronization code.
        	Hashtable is synchronized.
        	It is thread-safe and can be shared with many threads.*/
